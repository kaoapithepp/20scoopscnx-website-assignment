## Disclaimer
I spent time for this project just only 5 hours including design and development. There are still flaws and issues inside the project. Besides, I have to do this whit Typescript language but in the less time situation so I chose the Javascript instead to rapidly create the mock up and deliver the job.

## Structure
After read the requirement, there are 2 sections we have to deal with which are 'Sign in System' and 'Registration System'.
